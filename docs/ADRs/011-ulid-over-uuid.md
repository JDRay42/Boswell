# ADR-011: ULID Over UUID for Claim Identifiers

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Claims need globally unique identifiers that can be generated by any agent independently (no central coordination) and support efficient temporal queries.

## Decision

**ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier)** over UUID. ULIDs are 128-bit identifiers where the first 48 bits are a millisecond-precision timestamp and the remaining 80 bits are random, encoded as a 26-character Crockford's Base32 string.

## Consequences

- **Chronologically sortable by string comparison.** The "what changed since timestamp X" query becomes a range scan on the primary key. No secondary index or separate timestamp column needed for temporal ordering.
- **No coordination required.** Any agent on any machine generates ULIDs independently — essential for agent swarms.
- **Monotonic within the same millisecond.** Compliant implementations increment the random portion, preserving deterministic ordering under high-frequency writes.
- **Rust ecosystem**: `ulid` crate on crates.io. Well-maintained.
